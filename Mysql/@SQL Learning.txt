Lead(expr, /N, /default) OVER (Window_specification | Window_name)
Lag(expr, N, default) OVER (Window_specification | Window_name)

    + expr: It can be a column or any bulit-in function.
    + N: It is a positive value which determine number of rows preceding/succeeding the current row. If it is omitted in query then its default value is 1.
    + default: It is the default value return by function in-case no row precedes/succeedes the current row by N rows. If it is missing then it is by default NULL.

    + Window_specification: It consist of query partition clause which determines how the query rows are partitioned and ordered.
    + Window_name: If window is specified elsewhere in the query then it is referenced using this Window_name.
